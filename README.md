### Bike-sharing predictor
# Help a bike-sharing company make business decisions

#### Returns the expected volume of business based on historical bike-rental data, so the company can predict the number of bikes they will need. First project for the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

## Prerequisites
1. Jupyter Notebooks
2. GPU
3. The [bike-sharing dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) from the UCI Machine Learning Database.
4. PyTorch and Torchvision. For installation instructions see [Udacity's README in the Deep Learning repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch "Title").

## Tips
#### Watch out for size mismatch.
Almost all the challenges I ran into with this project happened as a result of size mismatch. Read the comments in my code to see where I had these problems and how I solved them.
